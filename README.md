### This documentation is not really complete.
### But it gives a basic overview.
### Look into the dotfiles for more information about all my shortcuts

## Setup
:: The setup script will backup your config to files named $filename.before_manuelraa_dotfiles  
:: To get your config back just rename/copy the .before_manuelraa_dotfiles file to the original name without the ending

Run setup.sh and follow the instructions posted after the installation
```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Tools I use

### Flameshot
An awesome screenshot tool

### httpie
A tool for REST Apis. Perfect for testing

### pipenv
Hate to have an .venv folder for every project? Pipenv is a venv manager which stores the venv outside the project
and makes it easy to activate it from inside a project

### zsh
Because bash simply is to simple. zsh offers better design, advanced completions and more

### termite
A slic terminal emulator I use. Kinda "hard" to install on Ubuntu. But give it a try

### termite-style
a simple tool to design your termite as u like it

### neovim
the main advantage over vim is that it can copy into system clipboard. Helpfull to copy out of tmux. tmux copy mode is shit...

### tmux
tool to structure multiple shells. my config makes it useable in my opinion.
it lets u use the mouse selection clipboard, easy pane switching using alt + vim/arrow keys, window/tab switching using shift + arrow keys and more
